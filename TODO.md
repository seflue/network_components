- [x] initially design interaction between controlBand and user plane
- [x] implement multiple user equipment
  - [x] make station a struct with address string and quality as int
  - [x] allow multiple stations within UserEquipment
    - [x] adjust class structure and construction
    - [x] adjust scan method
    - [x] repair broken channel construction
- [x] repair build: use GCC 10 or higher, repair g++ and gcc update alternatives
- [x] extend control plane with connect and disconnect messages
  - [x] implement "Connect"
    - [x] implement client side
      - [x] wrap client protocol in ControlClient
      - [x] send connect request before creating sender
      - [x] send disconnect request after file has been completely sent
      - [x] fix segfault on client side
    - [x] put filename into request at client side
    - [x] read filename from request at server side
    - [x] fix connection pool client availability
  - [x] implement "Disconnect"
    - [x] implement client side
    - [x] implement server side
- [x] implement user plane
  - [x] implement simple UDP data transfer
    - [x] make Poco headers successfully available
    - [x] implement client side
    - [x] implement server side
  - [x] fix Poco::IOException within receiveData (socket.bind)
  - [x] replace couts with sane logging library
  - [x] implement asynchronous socket reading on server side
    - [x] fix issue with not getting notified about readable socket
    - [x] fix issue with not writing successfully to file
- [x] implement dynamic quality
  - [x] Make quality in Protobuf protocol an int
  - [x] implement quality generator as separate thread
- [x] add DataConsumer,
  - [x] checks, if data is available (return random value)
- [x] add clang-format configuration
- [x] Move source into src folder
- [x] install gcc-13 in docker or use gcc-13 ready base container
- [x] repair docker build: use conan protoc instead of /usr/bin/protoc
- [x] create multiple processes
- [x] allow multiple user connections
- [x] implement multiple base stations
  - [x] start multiple base stations via IDE configuration
  - [x] implement startup script to fire up a zoo of base stations
## Next
- [ ] remove busy-waiting for _timer checking
  - [ ] evaluate using a state machine
  - [ ] move _timer into ControlClient and start scanning as separate thread
- [ ] improve startup script to also create zoo of user equipments
- [ ] implement state machine for user equipment
- [ ] Cleanup ConnectionPool
  - [ ] Create and erase connections on the fly instead of pre-creation
- [ ] Cleanup docker build
  - [x] remove bincrafters remote
  - [ ] pass existing conanfile.txt to conan_cmake_configure
- [ ] cleanup build scripts
  - [x] Write documentation for build.sh
  - [ ] Exchange Wsl env parameter option with something more windows agnostic
- [ ] consolidate CLion build
  - [x] repair conan cmake lookup when called from CLion
  - [ ] use preset files to persist CLion CMake configuration
